# Algorithmic Trading Strategy with Sentiment Analysis and Risk Management

## Overview

This project demonstrates an advanced algorithmic trading strategy that integrates **Sentiment Analysis** and **Risk Management** to improve trading decisions. The strategy uses a moving average crossover technique enhanced by sentiment data derived from news headlines. Additionally, it includes robust risk management features like position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit mechanisms to ensure better risk-adjusted returns.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: 
  - Utilizes the `TextBlob` library to analyze the sentiment of news headlines related to a selected stock.
  - Adjusts trading signals based on the sentiment score to improve decision-making.

- **Moving Average Crossover Strategy**: 
  - Implements a basic strategy where a buy signal is generated when the 20-day SMA crosses above the 50-day SMA, and a sell signal when the 20-day SMA crosses below the 50-day SMA.
  - Trading signals are adjusted based on sentiment analysis.

- **Risk Management**: 
  - **Position Sizing**: Dynamically adjusts position size based on the stock's volatility using the Average True Range (ATR).
  - **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit**: Implements stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage risk effectively.
  - **Sharpe Ratio**: Calculates the Sharpe Ratio to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy.
